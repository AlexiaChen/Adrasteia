% EXTRINSICDEMO Demonstrates how to find extrinsic calibration.
%    EXTRINSICDEMO can be used to obtain and visualize the
%    extrinsic calibration for the "desktop scanning" configuration,
%    as presented in:
%
%       J.-Y. Bouguet and P. Perona, "3D photography using shadows
%       in dual-space geometry", International Journal of Computer
%       Vision (IJCV), 1999.
%     
%    Please read the accompanying course notes handout for more
%    detailed descriptions of the included support code.
